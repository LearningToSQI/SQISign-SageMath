"""
Functions which solve lattice problems for use in subalgorithms of KLPT.

For KLPT there are a few spots where we need to enumerate short vectors
of lattices to ensure the smallest possible solutions to Diophantine equations.

Namely, we need close vectors to a special lattice for the strong approximation
to ensure the output bound is ~pN^3. This is accomplished with GenerateCloseVectors.
We use FPYLLL for the underlying lattice computations, which seem to outperform
Pari. We also have the ability to enumerate rather than precompute all vectors, 
which is better than Pari's qfminim.

For the generation of equivalent prime norm ideals, we have an ideal basis and 
we find short norm vectors of this and immediately output algebra elements. 
There's probably ways to reuse the GenerateShortVectors, but there's a few 
things about the prime norm elements which require special treatment so we 
chose to suffer code duplication for clearer specific functions.
